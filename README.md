# Vuejs 2 + Semantic UI + Store + jQuery Datatables


> Vue + Semantic UI + Store boilerplate

A simple project built upon VueJs 2 with Vuex store used to populate a table built with jQuery Datatables and Semantic UI css.
The main page consists of a table and a small form; the form has an add button to add new entries to the table.

If no API server is found on localhost:8080, the IndexDB will be used instead.
